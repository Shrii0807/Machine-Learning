**#Machine Learning**

Welcome to my beginner-friendly Machine Learning repository! 🚀 This is where I’ve organized my collection of code, datasets, and resources to support my journey in learning and experimenting with ML concepts.

Here’s what I’ve included:


- **👩‍💻 Step-by-Step Learning**: I structured examples in an easy-to-follow way, guiding myself through each phase of building and training machine learning models—from data preprocessing to evaluation.
  

- **🤖 Popular ML Algorithms**: I experimented with essential models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Clustering, and Neural Networks, gaining hands-on experience with each.
  

- **📊 Real-World Datasets**: I worked with curated datasets to get practical experience, focusing on data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization insights.
  

- **📝 Clear Code & Documentation**: Each code snippet is fully documented with comments to clarify important steps, parameter choices, and performance metrics.
  

This repository reflects my approach to learning and building a strong foundation in machine learning. 🌱
